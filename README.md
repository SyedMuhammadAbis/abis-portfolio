## What is this project?
This is a modern, interactive portfolio website. It's designed to:
- Show off your projects, skills, and experience
- Look beautiful and work smoothly on both desktop and mobile
- Be easy to update, extend, and maintain

You can use it as a template for your own portfolio, or as a learning resource for modern web design.

## Functionality Breakdown

### Navigation
- **What it does:** Fixed navigation bar at the top with smooth scrolling to sections.
- **How it works:**
  - All nav links use anchor tags (`<a href="#section">`).
  - Smooth scroll is handled in `js/script.js` with an event listener on all anchor tags.
  - The navigation is responsive and collapses into a mobile menu on small screens.
- **How to customize:** Add or remove links in `index.html` under the `<nav>` section.

### Custom Cursor
- **What it does:** Replaces the default mouse cursor with a custom animated one (and a follower effect).
- **How it works:**
  - Implemented in `js/script.js` in the `initCustomCursor` function.
  - Uses two divs (`.cursor` and `.cursor-follower`) styled in CSS.
- **How to customize:** Change the style in `styles.css` or update the JS for different effects.

### Text Scramble Effect
- **What it does:** Animates your name and section titles with a "scrambling" text effect.
- **How it works:**
  - The `TextScramble` class in `js/script.js` handles the animation.
  - Phrases are set in the JS (e.g., your name, "Game Developer", etc.).
- **How to customize:** Edit the phrases in `js/script.js` where `TextScramble` is used.

### 3D Background (Desktop Only)
- **What it does:** Subtle, animated 3D models float in the background on desktop.
- **How it works:**
  - Uses Three.js, loaded in `js/script.js` (`initThreeBackground` function).
  - Models are in `assets/models/`.
  - Disabled on mobile for performance.
  - Uses dynamic path resolution for GitHub Pages compatibility (works both locally and when deployed).
- **How to customize:** Add or replace models in `assets/models/` and update the config in `js/script.js`.

### Particle Background
- **What it does:** Animated particles float in the background (always enabled, but fewer on mobile).
- **How it works:**
  - Implemented in `js/script.js` (`initParticleAnimation` function).
  - Uses a `<canvas>` element for rendering.
- **How to customize:** Change the number, color, or speed of particles in the JS.

### Modals (Projects & Skills)
- **What it does:** Clicking a project or skill card opens a modal with more info.
- **How it works:**
  - Project modals: See `initializeModals` in `js/script.js`.
  - Skill modals: See `initializeSkillPopups` in `js/script.js`.
  - Modal HTML is in `index.html` (look for `#project-modal` and `#skill-modal`).
  - Background scroll is prevented when modals are open for better UX.
- **How to customize:** Update the modal content in the JS data objects, or change the modal layout in the HTML.

### Volume Slider
- **What it does:** Lets users adjust the background music volume. Appears on hover/click.
- **How it works:**
  - The slider is in the nav bar (`index.html`), styled in `styles.css`.
  - JS logic in `js/script.js` shows/hides the slider and updates the audio volume.
- **How to customize:** Change the style in CSS, or adjust the show/hide logic in JS.

### Image Gallery (in Project Modals)
- **What it does:** Lets users view multiple screenshots for each project.
- **How it works:**
  - Images are listed in the `projectData` object in `js/script.js`.
  - The gallery uses WebP images if available, with fallback to JPEG/PNG.
  - Navigation arrows let users cycle through images.
- **How to customize:** Add more images to the `images` array for each project in the JS.

### Sound Effects
- **What it does:** Plays sounds for button clicks, navigation, and other actions.
- **How it works:**
  - The `playAudio` function in `js/script.js` handles all sound playback.
  - Audio files are in `assets/audio/`.
- **How to customize:** Add new audio files and call `playAudio('your_sound')` in the JS.

### Consent Overlay (for Music)
- **What it does:** Shows an overlay asking for permission to play background music (required by browsers).
- **How it works:**
  - The overlay is in `index.html` (`#audio-consent-overlay`).
  - Logic is in `js/script.js` (shows on page load, hides on consent).
- **How to customize:** Change the overlay text or style in HTML/CSS.

### Accessibility
- **What it does:** Ensures the site is usable by everyone, including keyboard and screen reader users.
- **How it works:**
  - All images have `alt` text.
  - Modals can be closed with the keyboard.
  - Buttons and links have clear focus states.
- **How to customize:** Add ARIA roles or further improve focus/keyboard handling in HTML/JS.

### Easter Eggs
- **What it does:** Typing certain codes (like "vapour" or "retro") changes the site's theme.
- **How it works:**
  - Logic is in `js/script.js` (look for the keydown event and theme change code).
- **How to customize:** Add more codes or effects in the JS.

### Performance
- **What it does:** Ensures the site loads fast and works well on all devices.
- **How it works:**
  - Images are optimized and use WebP where possible.
  - Audio is compressed for fast loading.
  - 3D and heavy animations are disabled on mobile.
- **How to customize:** Further compress images/audio, or tweak which features are enabled on mobile.

## How to Add or Change Content

### **Add a New Project**
1. Create a new folder in `assets/projects/` for your project (e.g., `assets/projects/my-new-project/`).
2. Add your images (JPG/PNG and WebP) and a GIF to the project folder.
3. In `js/script.js`, find the `projectData` object. Add a new entry for your project:
   ```js
   'my-new-project': {
     title: 'My New Project',
     description: 'A detailed description here...',
     images: [
       './assets/projects/my-new-project/my_new_project_gallery1.jpg',
       './assets/projects/my-new-project/my_new_project_screenshot1.jpg',
     ],
     gifUrl: './assets/projects/my-new-project/my_new_project_demo.gif',
     videoUrl: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/your_video_id',
     youtubeUrl: 'https://youtu.be/your_video_id'
   }
   ```
4. Add a new project card in `index.html` (copy an existing one and update the `data-project-id` and image paths).

### **Add a New Skill**
1. In `js/script.js`, find the `skillData` object. Add a new entry:
   ```js
   myskill: {
     title: 'My Skill',
     description: 'What you do with this skill.'
   }
   ```
2. Add a new skill card in `index.html` (copy an existing one and update the `data-skill-id`).

### **Add a Blog Post**
- In `index.html`, copy a blog card and update the title, summary, and link.

### **Update Social Links**
- In `index.html`, find the "Contact" section and update the links as needed.

---

## How to Build, Deploy, or Host

### **For Development**
- You can open `index.html` directly in your browser to test locally.
- For best results (especially with audio and WebP), use a local server (like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VSCode, or `python -m http.server`).

### **For Deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages)**
- Push all your files to your GitHub repository.
- Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings (set the source to the root or `/docs` folder).
- Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo/`.

---

## How to Optimize or Extend

### **Images**
- Use WebP for best performance. Keep JPEG/PNG as fallback.
- Use `loading="lazy"` for all images.

### **Audio**
- Use the provided optimized files for fast loading.
- If you add new sounds, optimize them with ffmpeg (128kbps mono is a good default).

### **3D Backgrounds**
- Only enabled on desktop for performance. To add new models, put them in `assets/models/` and update the Three.js config in `js/script.js`.

### **Accessibility**
- All images have `alt` text.
- All modals and buttons are keyboard accessible.
- Sound and visual feedback for all major actions.

### **Customizing Styles**
- All styles are in `styles.css`. Use CSS variables for colors and themes.
- Custom scrollbars and sliders are styled for a modern, glassy look.

### **Easter Eggs**
- You can add more keyboard codes in `js/script.js` for fun theme changes or surprises.
